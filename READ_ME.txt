Files in this folder are sources file of "basic" plugin.
These sources have been created using Visual Studio 2010 Express, the compiler Visual C++.
You should load the "plugin_trng.sln" (solution) file.
The code contains only standard functions and structure for basic plugin.
You should use these sources to follow the tutorial described in Plugin_SDK.htm help file.
You should use these sources, too, when you mean starting to create your own plugin.
You can add to this code the objects or skill you find in final plugin_trng sources, of course, anyway it's better starting from scratch,using these sources, rather starting from final plugin sources, where there are a lot of useless patches and experiments that could generate conflicts with other plugins that used same old demo plugin code.
