Description

* Item 3D models can be any moveable slot
* Custom item actions

* Stopwatch with hour, minute and second hands
* Passport with load/save/quit or custom actions
* Maps with markers and custom actions
* Custom lighting

Using the Inventory
-------------------
The new inventory should be usable after installing the plugin. To test, start a new game and press the Inventory key.

Note: Any existing savegames created before installing the plugin may not work and can result in a crash.

Basic Navigation:
* To change the selected item, press Left or Right.
* To change to the next or previous available ring, press Up or Down.
* To activate the current selected item and show its available actions, press the Action or Enter key.
* While the action menu is displayed, press Up or Down to select one of the available actions. For special items like passports and maps, press Left or Right instead.
* To execute a selected action, press the Action or Enter key again.

Tip: To execute the first available action of a selected item without showing the menu, press and hold the Action or Enter key.

* To rotate an item being examined, press Left, Right, Up or Down.
* To cancel and return to a previous screen, press the Inventory or Esc key.

Scripting
---------
See the CUST_CINV_... constants in NG Center's Reference panel to see what's possible to customize through scripting.

Triggers and Conditions
-----------------------
See the Set Trigger Type window for this plugin in NGLE to see what triggers and conditions are available.

Known Issues and Workarounds
----------------------------
* Saving through the inventory saves and then loads the savegame when CUST_KEEP_DEAD_ENEMIES is enabled and at least one enemy has been killed.

* Item meshes can be a bit jittery when in motion.

* Item animations only support a frame rate of 1. Any higher rate will result in sped up animations.

* A too large of a value for item scale causes texture rendering issues for items with shine applied.

* Camera view might differ somewhat between fullscreen and windowed modes.

* The pickup notifier is disabled when a fixed camera is active.
If you pick something up during this time it won't show on-screen even after the fixed camera is done.
The notifier is also disabled during flyby cams, but items picked up during this time will be shown once the flyby is done.
	
* The configured mesh-mask of an item's model doesn't work for the pickup notifier, e.g. the revolver will be shown on screen with the lasersight and torch attached when picked up.
For now a solution would be to change the item's pickup model in the script to a slot containing only the desired meshes.
	
* The pickup notifier will not use the configured display settings to ignore animation position and orientation.
This is mostly a problem with items which are initially off-centre from their 3D origin, e.g. attached to walls.
Similar solution as for the mesh-mask issue, i.e. change pickup model to one that's positioned at the origin.
	
* Inventory background image might blink on certain computers. This also happens without the plugin. Soft Full Screen seems to fix it.

* Only the Numpad keys are usable in debug mode to change camera and ring settings.

* Only the Left Ctrl button is usable in debug mode to alternate between positioning and orienting.

* The currently selected ring and item is reset to default (INVENTORY ring, first item) between level jumps and after using up the last item on a ring.
Make sure there is always at least one item available on the INVENTORY ring.
