Description

Using the Inventory
-------------------
The new inventory should be usable after installing the plugin. To test, start a new game and press the Inventory key.

Note: Any existing savegames created before installing the plugin may not work and can result in a crash.

Basic Navigation:
* To change the selected item, press Left or Right.
* To change to the next or previous available ring, press Up or Down.
* To activate the current selected item and show its available actions, press the Action or Enter key.
* While the action menu is displayed, press Up or Down to select one of the available actions. For special items like passports and maps, press Left or Right instead.
* To execute a selected action, press the Action or Enter key again.

Tip: To execute the first available action of a selected item without showing the menu, press and hold the Action or Enter key.

* To rotate an item being examined, press Left, Right, Up or Down.
* To cancel and return to a previous screen, press the Inventory or Esc key.

Scripting
---------
See the CUST_CINV_... constants in NG Center's Reference panel to see what's possible to customize through scripting.

Triggers and Conditions
-----------------------
See the Set Trigger Type window for this plugin in NGLE to see what triggers and conditions are available.

Known Issues and Workarounds
----------------------------
* Item meshes can be a bit jittery when in motion.

* Item animations only support a frame rate of 1. Any higher rate will result in sped up animations.

* A too large of a value for item scale causes texture rendering issues for items with shine applied.

* Camera view might differ somewhat between fullscreen and windowed modes.
	
* The configured mesh-mask of an item's model doesn't work for the pickup notifier, e.g. the revolver will be shown on screen with the lasersight and torch attached when picked up.
For now a solution would be to change the item's pickup model in the script to a slot containing only the desired meshes.
	
* The pickup notifier will not use the configured display settings to ignore animation position and orientation.
This is mostly a problem with items which are initially off-centre from their 3D origin, e.g. attached to walls.
Similar solution as for the mesh-mask issue, i.e. change pickup model to one that's positioned at the origin.
	
* Inventory background image might blink on certain computers. This also happens without the plugin. Soft Full Screen seems to fix it.

* Only the Numpad keys are usable in debug mode to change camera and ring settings, and only the Left Ctrl button to alternate between positioning and orienting.

* The currently selected ring and item is reset to default (INVENTORY ring, first item) between level jumps and after using up the last item on a ring.
Be sure to always have at least one item available on the INVENTORY ring.
