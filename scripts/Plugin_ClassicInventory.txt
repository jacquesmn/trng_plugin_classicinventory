Classic Inventory Plugin
------------------------
Plugin version: 0.9.0.0
Required TRNG version: 1.3.0.7

Description
-----------
This plugin replaces the TR4 sliding inventory with one resembling the "classic" TR1-3 ring.

Not everything is exactly as in the originals. For example the save, load and options screens are still the same as TR4/TRNG.

This is also just for the in-game inventory, the title screen hasn't been touched.

Scripting
---------
See the CUST_CINV_... constants in NG Center's Reference panel to see what's possible to customize through scripting.

Triggers and Conditions
-----------------------
See the Set Trigger Type window in NGLE for this plugin.
