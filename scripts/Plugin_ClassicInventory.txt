Description
-----------
This plugin replaces the TR4 sliding inventory with one resembling the "classic" TR1-3 ring.

Not everything is exactly as in the originals. For example the save, load and options screens are still the same as TR4/TRNG.

This is also just for the in-game inventory, the title screen hasn't been altered.

Scripting
---------
See the CUST_CINV_... constants in NG Center's Reference panel to see what's possible to customize through scripting.

Triggers and Conditions
-----------------------
See the Set Trigger Type window in NGLE for this plugin to see what triggers and conditions are available.

Known Issues and Workarounds
----------------------------
* Items have a water effect applied when the camera is underwater.

* Item meshes can be a bit jittery when in motion.

* A too large of a value for item scale causes texture rendering issues for items with shine applied.

* Camera view might differ somewhat between fullscreen and windowed modes.

* The pickup notifier is disabled when a fixed camera is active.
	
* The configured mesh-mask of an item's model doesn't work for the pickup notifier, e.g. the revolver will be shown on screen with the lasersight and torch attached when picked up.
For now a solution would be to change the item's pickup model in the script to a slot containing only the desired meshes.
	
* The pickup notifier will not use the configured display settings to ignore animation position and orientation.
This is mostly a problem with items which are initially off-center from their 3D origin, e.g. attached to walls.
Similar solution as for the mesh-mask issue, i.e. change pickup model to one that's positioned at the origin.
	
* Inventory background image might blink on certain computers. This also happens without the plugin. Soft Full Screen seems to fix it.

* The WEAPONS cheat had to be changed to WEAPON.

* Only the numpad keys are usable in debug mode to change camera and ring settings.

* Only the Left Ctrl button is usable in debug mode to alternate between positioning and orienting.

* The currently selected ring and item is reset to default (Inventory ring, first item) between level jumps.
